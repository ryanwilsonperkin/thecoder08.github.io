Book 2: Territory

Camerica is a small City-State, a self-governing territory considered a city. The laws of Camerica apply within its borders, no farther and no smaller. The borders are created and expanded on by adding city blocks. City blocks are an area of grass surrounded by roads. the city is built on top of the blocks. The territory is ever changing as of when this constitution was written, and it will probably be constantly changing forever. The border surrounds all of the city blocks. Every block, from bedrock to sky limit, is in Camerica's territory and therefore all of its laws apply. If territory is outside its borders, no laws apply. For all that is concerned, it is anarchic, that is, unless another state is created and acknoledged by the Government of Camerica, in which case, that state's laws and constitution apply. If a dispute with another acknoledged state is come across, the dispute must be settled as soon as possible. If it is not settled, the opposing state must be forcibly removed from the area. If they fight back, war must be declared on the opposing state.

Book 3: Government

Camerica's government is considered a benevolent constitutional dictatorship and monarchy. It has 3 official positions of power that can be occupied by a single person each. The mayor, the deputy mayor, and the monarch. The mayor is considered a dictator, although the position is not called as such. He or she has absolute power* over the city-state. He or she can add, remove, and change laws, as well as in rare occations, pass constitutional amendments. The position is occupied by Camerica's founder, Lennon McLean. If the mayor feels no longer fit for the position, he or she may choose any other citzen of Camerica to be the next mayor. The mayor is never constitutionally obliged to give up power at any point. The deputy mayor acts as an advisor/assistant to the mayor. They have the same powers except that when the deputy mayor uses his or her powers, consent must be given in a written format by the mayor. The position is occupied by Camerica's co-founder, Noah Bell. The same power-changing laws apply to the deputy mayor as the mayor. The monarch also has absolute power* over Camerica, however, cannot control when he or she can use it. Whenever the mayor sees fit, he or she can oblige the monarch to use their power in a specific fashion. The monarch is CONSTITUTIONALLY OBLIGED to use their power immidiately upon demand, and never any other time. The position is initially occupied by Cole Generic. The monarch must give up their power and choose a citizen to take over as monarch on January 1st every year. They can also choose to give up power at any other time.

* Absolute power refers to the ability to do anything they would like. However, if a law prohibits a certain action, they mustn't do that action.
