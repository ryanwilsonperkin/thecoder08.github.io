# How to start an ISP

So, you want to make you own ISP?

Well, that's a pretty big project! If you're willing to put in the time and money, it could be a pretty profitable business. Here are the main steps to building your own ISP.

## Start small

The first thing you need to do when building and ISP (or starting any business) is to get funding. Get investors interested in your project! They can give you funding for your project in exchange for a portion of your profits. Once you have some initial funding, you can get a connection to the internet. This can be done by purchasing a fiber plan from an existing ISP. This plan must have very high bandwidth as it's going to provide connectivity for all of your customers!

The next step is to begin building up your infrastructure. In this case we're going to be building a cable ISP, as it doesn't require a whole lot of money like fiber. To start we might just provide coverage for a single neighborhood. We need to create a base for your infrastructure. This is where your network physically connects to the fiber that you purchased. You'll need an adapter to connect the fiber cable to a gateway device. This is a server responsible for forwarding all outgoing traffic from your network out to the broader internet, and vice versa. This server needs two network interfaces: one that connects to the fiber, and one the connects to a cable modem.

Once you have your base infrastructure in place, you can start laying cable. You'll need to acquire a permit that allows you to burry cable underground on the side of the roads. At regular intervals, your cable should pop up out of the ground to connect to a Coaxial Interconnect Box (CIB) which is usually grey. This splits off four small cables, one for each customer, from the main cable. For now, continue laying cable and installing CIBs throughout your area of service.

## Getting bigger

Eventually, a customer will want to have service. To connect them to the network, simply run a cable from the nearest CIB to a box on the client's property, usually on their house, called an on-property box (OPB). This box just contains a female-female coaxial adapter, to connect the line to the road with the customer's house's cable system. Inside the house, connect the cable to a modem, which gives them internet service. This may have a wireless router built in, providing WiFi to their house.

Along with internet, you may want to provide some simple analog TV. For this you'll need some C band satellite dishes. These are for getting TV signals directly from the TV stations themselves. These signals need to be multiplexed together into a single coaxial cable along with your internet connection. You can set this up in customers' houses very simply. Just split their cable between lines to the TVs and a line to the modem.

More and more clients will wants to join your network and eventually the cost of the infrastructure will be paid off, and you'll be running a successful ISP! Thanks for reading!
